# UNIBO Social Sports Sharing

This was a project developed for the database management course at my Bachelor's programme. It consists in a platform for organizing and registering in sport events at known university sports facilities, written in PHP and MySQL. The instructions for running the projects can be found below. I might make adjustments to this project for fun and practice, but otherwise this is just to showcase what I have done in the past.

## How to launch

1. Ensure XAMPP is installed and that Apache and MySQL services are running.
2. Navigate to the `database` folder and, in file `popolamento.sql`, replace the path with your own. [TODO: avoid absolute paths]
3. Run the SQL scripts in the `database` folder with the command `mysql -u root <SQLSCRIPT.sql`.
4. Copy and paste the `website` folder into the `htdocs` folder within the XAMPP installation path. [TODO: improve this step]
5. Navigate to `localhost/website` on your browser.

This procedure will be improved in the future.
